### Whiteboarding!

**PROMPT: Two Eggs and 100 Floors** The following is a description of the instance of this famous puzzle involving 2 eggs and a building with 100 floors. 

Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 100-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing. What strategy should be used to drop eggs such that total number of drops in worst case is minimized and we find the required floor.

We may make a few assumptions:

* An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
* A broken egg must be discarded.
* The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
* If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
* If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall.

1. [2D Array](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/2d-array/problem)

2. xplain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE:

    * `function foo(){ }();`

    * What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?

3. Build a binary search.
    * In its simplest form, binary search is used to quickly find a value in a sorted sequence (consider a sequence an ordinary array for now). We’ll call the sought value the target value for clarity. Binary search maintains a contiguous subsequence of the starting sequence where the target value is surely located. This is called the search space. The search space is initially the entire sequence. At each step, the algorithm compares the median value in the search space to the target value. Based on the comparison and because the sequence is sorted, it can then eliminate half of the search space. By doing this repeatedly, it will eventually be left with a search space consisting of a single element, the target value.
